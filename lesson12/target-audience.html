                <h3>Scenario 1</h3>
                <p>I am a small business owner who is looking to grow my business to the small towns of the southeastern part of the United States. I have 100's of 1000's in revenue every year. I am looking to expand to the smaller towns because I know that
                    those people find it hard to get the supplies they need. I want to be able to provide that for them.</p>

                <h3>Scenario 2</h3>
                <p>I own a profitable resturant in Prarieville, LA and I am looking to grow in business by reaching the people in Pride, Zachary, and Central areas. I recieve more than 400 customers a day and would like to expand that to possibly 1000 between
                    the two resturants. I am deciding where I want to build my new resturant and I am looking at Pride seeing it is somewhat of a underdeveloped, but promising town.</p>

                <h3>Scenario 3</h3>
                <p>My husband and I wealthy investors who enjoy the country lifestyle in Pride, LA. However, we and others would like to have more to do out here in Pride. The only things there are to do here is go to another city and find things to do.
                    We are looking to invest in businesses that would be willing to locate out to Pride.</p>

                <h3>Scenario 4</h3>
                <p>As the mayor of Pride it is hard to see my town not being shown on the map. People do not have anything to do here and are leaving to find places where there is a lot things to do. I want to help promote Pride to businesses so I can see
                    growth and help the city of Pride be built up as a great city.</p>

                <h3>Scenario 5</h3>
                <p>As a concerned citizen, I have seen that since there is only one store in all of Pride, their prices have skyrocketed. In order to get lower prices I have to drive to the next town over. Although, doing that costs the same amount of money
                    or even more in gasoline. I want there to be a diversity in Pride, so prices will level back out.</p>
